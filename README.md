> Open source Product Management skills for AI agents

**PM-Skills** is a curated collection of reusable instruction sets that help AI assistants produce high-quality PM artifacts—PRDs, problem statements, user stories, experiment designs, and more.

Built on the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), PM-Skills works across multiple AI platforms and follows the **Triple Diamond** framework for complete product development coverage.

---

## Highlights

- **24 Professional Skills** — Covering the entire product lifecycle from discovery to iteration
- **Triple Diamond Framework** — Organized across 6 phases: Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver, Measure, Iterate
- **Cross-Platform Compatible** — Works with Claude Code, Claude.ai, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and more
- **Production-Ready Templates** — Every skill includes templates and real-world examples
- **Framework Agnostic** — Skills map to Lean Startup, Design Thinking, and other methodologies via bundles

## Quick Start

### Claude Code (Recommended)

```bash
# Install from marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add product-on-purpose/pm-skills

# Use any skill
/prd
/problem-statement
/hypothesis
```

### Claude.ai / Claude Desktop

1. Download a skill ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/product-on-purpose/pm-skills/releases)
2. Go to **Settings > Capabilities**
3. Upload the ZIP file
4. Start a conversation and reference the skill

### GitHub Copilot / Cursor / Windsurf

Skills are auto-discovered via `AGENTS.md`. Clone or fork this repository, and your AI assistant will find the skills automatically.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/product-on-purpose/pm-skills.git
```

### Manual Installation

Copy any skill folder to your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```
your-project/
└── .claude/
    └── skills/
        └── problem-statement/
            ├── SKILL.md
            └── references/
                ├── TEMPLATE.md
                └── EXAMPLE.md
