# Session Log: 2026-01-14

**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Focus:** Phase 3 Infrastructure Implementation (Complete)

## Summary

Completed all Phase 3 Infrastructure items: workflow bundles (3), slash commands (5), AGENTS.md generation, and GitHub Actions workflows (2). This marks the completion of PM-Skills v1.0.0 with all 24 skills and supporting infrastructure implemented.

## Accomplishments

- **Workflow Bundles (3 files):**
  - `_bundles/triple-diamond.md` — Complete product development cycle with all 6 phases, skill mappings, transition criteria
  - `_bundles/lean-startup.md` — Build-Measure-Learn guide with 5-skill minimal loop, pivot types reference
  - `_bundles/feature-kickoff.md` — Quick-start workflow with time estimates, example walkthrough

- **Slash Commands (5 files):**
  - `commands/prd.md` — PRD creation
  - `commands/problem-statement.md` — Problem framing
  - `commands/hypothesis.md` — Hypothesis definition
  - `commands/user-stories.md` — Story generation
  - `commands/kickoff.md` — Multi-skill Feature Kickoff sequence

- **Agent Discovery:**
  - `AGENTS.md` — Universal discovery file listing all 24 skills with paths and descriptions

- **GitHub Actions (2 workflows):**
  - `.github/workflows/sync-agents-md.yml` — Auto-regenerates AGENTS.md when skills change
  - `.github/workflows/release-zips.yml` — Packages individual skills and complete bundle as ZIPs on release

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - CHANGELOG.md — Added all infrastructure items
  - CONTEXT.md — Updated status to "Phase 3 COMPLETE (v1.0.0 ready)"
  - README.md — Marked Phase 3 Infrastructure complete
  - plan-v1.md — Updated progress tracker with GitHub issue links

## Decisions Made

- **Bundle structure:** Each bundle includes overview, when to use, skill mappings per phase, suggested sequence, and cross-references to other bundles
- **Slash command format:** Simple frontmatter with description, reference to skill path, and $ARGUMENTS placeholder
- **kickoff command:** Sequences 4 skills (problem-statement → hypothesis → prd → user-stories) with instructions for each step
- **GitHub Actions:** sync-agents-md uses bash script to parse skill frontmatter; release-zips creates individual skill ZIPs plus complete bundle

## Issues Encountered

- None significant. Continued from prior session context without issues.

## Next Session

Recommended starting point and priorities:

1. **v1.0.0 Release:**
   - Create git tag for v1.0.0
   - Create GitHub release
   - Verify GitHub Actions run correctly
   - Test release ZIPs

2. **Testing:**
   - Test slash commands work correctly
   - Verify AGENTS.md is discoverable by agents

3. **Documentation polish:**
   - Final review of README.md
   - Verify all links work

## Session Highlights

### Complete Infrastructure Delivery
> Implemented all remaining Phase 3 items in a single session:
> - 3 workflow bundles with comprehensive documentation
> - 5 slash commands for Claude Code integration

> - 2 GitHub Actions for automation

*This completes the v1.0.0 feature set. PM-Skills now has full Triple Diamond coverage with 24 skills, 3 workflow bundles, and cross-platform support.*

### Workflow Bundle Quality
> Each bundle was designed to be actionable and practical:

> - Lean Startup: Includes 5-skill minimal loop for rapid iteration
> - Feature Kickoff: Time estimates and complete example walkthrough

*Bundles serve as both documentation and practical guides for using skill combinations.*
