# Session Log: 2026-01-14 15:30

## Summary

Completed Phase 0 foundation work and prepared for v0.1.0 release. All GitHub issues (#1-9) closed, README roadmap updated to reflect Phase 0 completion, and wrap-session workflow executed for documentation.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Completed Issue #8** — Updated example dates in templates
   - Changed hardcoded `2025-01-15` to `<YYYY-MM-DD>` placeholder
   - Updated both `_templates/skill-template/references/EXAMPLE.md` and plan-v1.md

2. **Updated README.md Roadmap**
   - Changed Phase 0 status from "~40% complete" to "COMPLETE"
   - Checked all Phase 0 items as completed

3. **Executed wrap-session workflow**
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with complete Phase 0 entries
   - Updated CONTEXT.md to reflect Phase 0 complete status
   - Updated TODO.md with Phase 0 completion, ready for Phase 1

## Decisions Made

No new architectural decisions. Continued execution of established patterns.

## Issues Encountered

- Session context compaction occurred mid-workflow
- Successfully resumed from summary without user intervention

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Execute Phase 1: P0 Core Skills** (Issues #6-10)
   - Start with `problem-statement` as reference implementation
   - All 5 skills can be executed in parallel
   - Use `_templates/skill-template/` as base structure

2. **After completing v0.1.0 release:**
   - Commit all changes
   - Push to remote
   - Tag as v0.1.0

## Session Highlights

### User Request: Release Sequence
User asked about order of operations for:
1. /wrap-session tasks
2. v0.1.0 release packaging
3. README/planning updates

Recommended sequence: Updates first, wrap-session second, release last (ensures commit captures complete state).

- `README.md` — Roadmap updated to Phase 0 complete
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Added Phase 0 completion entries
- `AGENTS/claude-opus-4.5/CONTEXT.md` — Status updated
