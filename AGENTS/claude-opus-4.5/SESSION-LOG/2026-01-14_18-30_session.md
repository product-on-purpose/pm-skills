# Session Log: 2026-01-14

**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Focus:** Phase 3 P2 Skills Implementation (Complete)

## Summary

Completed all 11 P2 Skills for Phase 3, achieving full Triple Diamond framework coverage with 24/24 skills implemented. Created GitHub infrastructure (labels, issues #26-36) and implemented each skill with comprehensive SKILL.md instructions, TEMPLATE.md formats, and realistic EXAMPLE.md demonstrations.

## Accomplishments

- Created GitHub labels: `phase-3`, `P2`
- Created 11 GitHub issues (#26-36) for P2 skills tracking
- Implemented all 11 P2 skills:
  - **Discover phase:** competitive-analysis, stakeholder-summary
  - **Define phase:** opportunity-tree, jtbd-canvas
  - **Develop phase:** design-rationale
  - **Measure phase:** dashboard-requirements, experiment-results
  - **Iterate phase:** retrospective, lessons-log, refinement-notes, pivot-decision
- Closed all 11 GitHub issues
- Updated CONTEXT.md with complete skills inventory
- Updated README.md skills badge (13/24 → 24/24), inventory, and roadmap
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with Phase 3 P2 changes

## Decisions Made

- **Milestone creation skipped:** GitHub CLI `gh milestone` command not available in this environment. Issues created without milestone assignment (can be added via API/web later)
- **Consistent skill structure:** All skills follow established pattern from Phase 1-2 with SKILL.md, TEMPLATE.md, EXAMPLE.md

## Issues Encountered

- **gh milestone command unavailable:** The `gh milestone create` command isn't available in the GitHub CLI version. Workaround: created issues without milestone, which can be assigned later via GitHub web UI or API
- No other significant issues

## Next Session

Recommended starting point and priorities:

1. **Phase 3 Infrastructure:** Begin implementing workflow bundles (triple-diamond, lean-startup, feature-kickoff)
2. **Slash Commands:** Create commands in `commands/` directory
3. **AGENTS.md:** Generate the universal agent discovery file
4. **README finalization:** Final polish and review
5. **GitHub Actions:** Set up automation workflows

## Next Session Prompt
