## Summary

Executed the open-skills ecosystem integration plan, discovering a bug in openskills CLI that affects both pm-skills and Anthropic's official skills repo. Created all necessary artifacts for publishing to awesome-claude-skills and n-skills marketplace.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Created Detailed Execution Plan**
   - Converted `plan-open-skills.md` into actionable `plan-open-skills_detailed.md`
   - Broke down into 10 tasks across 4 phases
   - Identified parallel vs sequential execution paths

2. **Completed Task 1.1: README Installation Instructions**
   - Restructured Quick Start with 4 clear options
   - Git clone now recommended (due to openskills bug)
   - Added openskills limitation warning with issue link

3. **Completed Task 1.2: openskills Compatibility Testing**
   - Discovered openskills fails with "Security error: Installation path outside target directory"
   - Tested against `anthropics/skills` — same error (17 skills, 0 installed)
   - Confirmed it's a tool bug, not a pm-skills structure issue
   - Filed [openskills#48](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills/issues/48)

4. **Completed Tasks 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1 in Parallel**
   - Created `awesome-claude-skills-pr.md` — ready to submit
   - Created `.github/workflows/release.yml` — automated ZIP creation
   - Created `n-skills-submission.md` — ready to submit
   - Added "See It In Action" section to README.md

5. **Created Manual Steps Guide**
   - `plan-open-skills_detailed_manual-steps.md` with step-by-step instructions
   - Covers awesome-claude-skills PR, n-skills submission, GitHub release

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Git clone as recommended install | openskills has bug with nested paths |
| File issue against openskills | Bug affects Anthropic's official repo too |
| Use current README workaround | Document both planned and current states |
| Create release workflow | Automate ZIP creation for Claude.ai users |

## Issues Encountered

1. **openskills Nested Path Bug**
   - Root cause: Path validation rejects `skills/category/skill-name/` structure
   - Impact: Blocks installation via openskills CLI
   - Resolution: Filed issue, documented workaround, recommend git clone

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Execute Manual Submissions**
   - Follow `plan-open-skills_detailed_manual-steps.md`
   - Submit awesome-claude-skills PR first (higher visibility)
   - Submit to n-skills marketplace

2. **Test Release Workflow**
   - Create v1.0.2 tag to trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Verify ZIP artifacts are created correctly

3. **Monitor openskills#48**
   - Watch for maintainer response
   - Update documentation when fixed

## Next Session Prompt

```
Continue the open-skills publishing effort for pm-skills.

Current status:
- All automated tasks complete (README updated, workflows created, submission content ready)
- openskills bug filed as #48
- Manual submissions pending

Next steps:
1. Review `_NOTES/efforts/open-skills/plan-open-skills_detailed_manual-steps.md`
2. Commit current changes and push
3. Create v1.0.2 tag to test release workflow
4. Begin manual submission to awesome-claude-skills

Key files:
- `_NOTES/efforts/open-skills/awesome-claude-skills-pr.md` — PR content
- `_NOTES/efforts/open-skills/n-skills-submission.md` — n-skills content
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — release automation
```

## Session Highlights

**Key Discovery:** openskills CLI has a bug that prevents installation from nested directory structures. This affects both pm-skills (`skills/define/hypothesis/`) and Anthropic's official `anthropics/skills` repo. The bug was filed as [openskills#48](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills/issues/48).

**Verification Test:**
```bash
npx openskills install anthropics/skills -y
# Found 17 skill(s)
# Security error: Installation path outside target directory (x17)
# ✅ Installation complete: 0 skill(s) installed
```

**Outcome:** pm-skills is fully open-skills compatible (follows agentskills.io spec). The openskills CLI tool has a bug — not a pm-skills structure issue.
