# Session Log: 2026-01-14 17:23

## Summary

Completed Phase 2 of the pm-skills project, implementing all 8 P1 priority skills across Discover, Develop, Deliver, and Measure phases. Created GitHub infrastructure (labels, milestone, issues) and updated all project documentation.

## Key Accomplishments

### GitHub Infrastructure
- Created `phase-2` and `P1` labels
- Created `v0.3.0 - P1 Skills` milestone
- Created and closed 8 GitHub issues (#18-25)

### Skills Implemented (8 total)

| Skill | Phase | Issue |
|-------|-------|-------|
| interview-synthesis | Discover | #18 |
| solution-brief | Develop | #19 |
| spike-summary | Develop | #20 |
| adr | Develop | #21 |
| edge-cases | Deliver | #22 |
| release-notes | Deliver | #23 |
| experiment-design | Measure | #24 |
| instrumentation-spec | Measure | #25 |

Each skill includes:
- `SKILL.md` - Instructions with frontmatter and quality checklist
- `references/TEMPLATE.md` - Fillable template with guidance
- `references/EXAMPLE.md` - Realistic completed example

### Documentation Updates
- README.md: Added status indicators (✅/🔜) to skills inventory, updated roadmap
- CHANGELOG.md: Added v0.3.0 release notes
- CONTEXT.md: Updated status to Phase 2 complete, added skills inventory table
- plan-v1.md: Updated Progress Tracker with GitHub issue links

## Decisions Made

1. **Skill structure consistency**: Maintained same pattern as Phase 1 (SKILL.md + TEMPLATE.md + EXAMPLE.md)
2. **Example scenarios**: Each example uses a different realistic business context to show versatility
3. **Status indicators in README**: Used emoji (✅/🔜) for quick visual scanning of implementation status

## Issues Encountered

None significant. Minor issue with Windows `nul` file being accidentally created was cleaned up before commit.

## Next Session Recommendations

### Phase 3: P2 Skills (11 skills)
1. Create GitHub infrastructure (phase-3 label, P2 label, v0.4.0 milestone)
2. Create issues for 11 remaining skills
3. Implement skills in order:
   - Discover: competitive-analysis, stakeholder-summary
   - Define: opportunity-tree, jtbd-canvas
   - Develop: design-rationale
   - Measure: dashboard-requirements, experiment-results
   - Iterate: retrospective, lessons-log, refinement-notes, pivot-decision

### Phase 3: Infrastructure
- After skills complete: bundles, slash commands, AGENTS.md, GitHub Actions

### Next Session Prompt

```
Continue pm-skills implementation from v0.3.0. Phase 2 is complete.

## Context
- Repository: product-on-purpose/pm-skills
- Current branch: jprisant/issue1
- Phase 0: Complete (foundation)
- Phase 1: Complete (5 P0 Core Skills)
- Phase 2: Complete (8 P1 Skills - GitHub #18-25 closed)

## Context Files
- AGENTS/claude-opus-4.5/CONTEXT.md
- _NOTES/v1-plan/plan-v1.md

## Next: Phase 3 - P2 Skills (11 skills)

1. Create GitHub infrastructure:
   - Labels: `phase-3`, `P2`
   - Milestone: "v0.4.0 - P2 Skills"
   - Issues for each skill

2. Implement skills:
   - competitive-analysis (Discover)
   - stakeholder-summary (Discover)
   - opportunity-tree (Define)
   - jtbd-canvas (Define)
   - design-rationale (Develop)
   - dashboard-requirements (Measure)
   - experiment-results (Measure)
   - retrospective (Iterate)
   - lessons-log (Iterate)
   - refinement-notes (Iterate)
   - pivot-decision (Iterate)

Use the same pattern as Phase 1-2: create GitHub issues, implement skills with SKILL.md + references/TEMPLATE.md + references/EXAMPLE.md, close issues.
```

## Session Highlights

### Efficient Parallelization
- Created all 8 GitHub issues in parallel bash calls
- Closed all 8 issues in parallel after implementation
- Minimized round-trips for faster execution

### Quality Examples Created
Each skill's EXAMPLE.md demonstrates professional PM work:
- `interview-synthesis`: B2B SaaS onboarding research with 5 participant synthesis
- `solution-brief`: E-commerce checkout redesign one-pager
- `spike-summary`: Payment processor evaluation (Stripe vs Adyen)
- `adr`: PostgreSQL database selection decision record
- `edge-cases`: File upload feature with 20+ edge cases documented
- `release-notes`: Project management tool monthly update
- `experiment-design`: A/B test design with sample size calculations
- `instrumentation-spec`: User onboarding event tracking specification
