# Session Log: 2026-01-14

**Focus:** Project initialization and README creation

## Summary

Initialized the pm-skills repository with agentic coding structure and created a comprehensive README.md. The project now has proper documentation scaffolding including LICENSE, CHANGELOG, .gitignore, and AGENTS folder for AI session continuity.

## Accomplishments

- Ran `/init-project` to set up agentic coding structure
- Created CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE (Apache 2.0), .gitignore
- Set up AGENTS/claude-opus-4.5/ with CONTEXT.md, TODO.md, DECISIONS.md, SESSION-LOG/
- Created comprehensive README.md based on `_NOTES/v1-plan/plan-v1.md`:
  - Added badges (License, PRs Welcome, Skills count, Agent Skills Spec)
  - Wrote Highlights section with key features
  - Created Quick Start guides for 4 platforms (Claude Code, Claude.ai, Copilot/Cursor, Manual)
  - Built complete Skills Inventory with 24 skills across 6 tables by phase
  - Added Workflow Bundles section
  - Created Platform Compatibility matrix (8 platforms)
  - Documented Skill Structure with frontmatter schema example
  - Added Repository Structure tree
  - Wrote Roadmap with progress tracking
  - Included Contributing section with quality criteria
  - Added Related Projects and Acknowledgments

## Decisions Made

- **Apache 2.0 License:** Chosen over MIT to align with agent skills ecosystem and provide explicit patent grant
- **README scope:** Made comprehensive rather than minimal, since VISION.md and plan-v1.md provide detailed context for the full project scope

## Issues Encountered

- None — straightforward initialization session

## Next Session

Recommended starting point and priorities:

1. Execute Issue #1 from plan-v1.md — Repository Bootstrap (create full directory structure with .gitkeep files for skills/, _bundles/, _docs/, etc.)
2. Execute Issues #2-4 — Schema documentation, category reference, skill template
3. Begin Issue #6 — Create `problem-statement` skill as reference implementation
4. Consider creating CONTRIBUTING.md if needed for external contributions

## Session Highlights

### Project Context
> PM-Skills follows the Agent Skills Specification and targets 24 skills across 6 Triple Diamond phases. The implementation plan (`_NOTES/v1-plan/plan-v1.md`) contains 35 detailed issues to guide development.

### Key Reference Files
- `_NOTES/VISION.md` — Full vision with schema, categories, roadmap
- `_NOTES/v1-plan/plan-v1.md` — Issue-by-issue implementation plan
- `_NOTES/v1-plan/SKILL.md` — Template for skill SKILL.md files
- `_NOTES/v1-plan/TEMPLATE.md` — Template for artifact templates
- `_NOTES/v1-plan/EXAMPLE.md` — Template for artifact examples
