# Session Log: 2026-01-15 09:00

## Summary

Completed all 24 slash commands for pm-skills, ensuring full parity between skills and Claude Code commands. Also reviewed and updated the open-skills publishing plan documentation.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Reviewed open-skills effort documentation**
   - Compared `Pm skills - open-skills.md` analysis with `plan-open-skills.md`
   - Updated plan document with current skill counts (5 → 24)
   - Marked AGENTS.md as complete
   - Added new "Distribution & Branding Strategy" section

2. **Updated GitHub Issue #15**
   - Changed proposed entry from 5 skills to 24 skills with Triple Diamond framework description

3. **Identified missing slash commands**
   - Found only 5 commands existed for 24 skills
   - Commands missing for: Discover (3), Define (2), Develop (4), Deliver (3), Measure (4), Iterate (4)

4. **Created all missing slash commands**
   - Created 20 GitHub issues (#43-62)
   - Created 20 command files in `commands/` directory
   - Closed all 20 issues with completion comments

5. **Updated documentation**
   - README.md: Expanded Slash Commands section with collapsible phase groups
   - AGENTS.md: Added all 24 commands organized by phase
   - CHANGELOG.md: Added v1.0.1 entry
   - plan-open-skills.md: Added slash commands row to compatibility table

## Decisions Made

- **Keep commands flat (no folders)**: Commands remain in flat `commands/` directory rather than mirroring the `skills/` folder structure. Commands are thin wrappers, so flat structure is simpler and matches user invocation patterns.

## Issues Encountered

- None significant

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Create v1.0.1 release** with the new slash commands
2. **Submit PR to awesome-claude-skills** (Issue #15) - all documentation now ready
3. **Test openskills installation** to verify compatibility
4. Consider addressing README installation clarity issues noted in analysis

## Next Session Prompt

```
Continue working on pm-skills open-skills distribution:

1. Create v1.0.1 git tag and GitHub release
2. Submit PR to awesome-claude-skills repository
3. Test openskills install compatibility
