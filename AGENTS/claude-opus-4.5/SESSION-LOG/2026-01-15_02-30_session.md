# Session Log: 2026-01-15

**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Focus:** v1.0.0 Release and Codex Review Response

## Summary

Completed the v1.0.0 release of PM-Skills, including creating the git tag, GitHub release with comprehensive release notes, and verifying the release-zips workflow. Also responded to Codex 5.2's repo review with inline annotations addressing all findings.

## Accomplishments

- Created v1.0.0 git tag with annotated message
- Published GitHub release with detailed release notes
- Verified release-zips.yml workflow (31 ZIPs uploaded automatically)
- Polished README.md with exciting, dynamic content
- Added inline responses to Codex v1 repo review document
- Merged `jprisant/issue1` branch to `main`
- Deleted feature branch after merge
- Updated CONTEXT.md and TODO.md for post-release state

## Decisions Made

- **AGENTS.md is auto-generated and minimal:** README serves as authoritative human-facing documentation; AGENTS.md is machine-facing discovery index
- **Unicode diagrams accepted:** Modern tooling handles UTF-8; will address if user feedback indicates issues
- **wrap-session location confirmed:** `.claude/skills/` is for contributor tools, `skills/` is for user PM skills

## Issues Encountered

- Local settings file blocked branch switch — resolved with `git stash`
- No other blockers

## Next Session

Recommended starting point and priorities:

1. Announce release (Twitter, LinkedIn, Product Hunt)
2. Consider v1.1.0 validation CI workflow
3. Monitor for user feedback
