# Session Log: 2026-01-14

## Summary

Completed Phase 1 of pm-skills implementation, creating 5 P0 Core Skills (problem-statement, hypothesis, prd, user-stories, launch-checklist). Established GitHub issue tracking infrastructure with labels, milestone, and issues #10-14. Updated plan-v1.md to align internal references with actual GitHub issue IDs.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Created GitHub Infrastructure**
   - Labels: `skill`, `phase-1`, `P0`
   - Milestone: "v0.2.0 - P0 Core Skills"
   - Issues #10-14 for each Phase 1 skill

2. **Implemented 5 P0 Core Skills**
   - `skills/define/problem-statement/` — Problem framing with user impact and success criteria
   - `skills/define/hypothesis/` — Testable hypotheses with metrics and validation approach
   - `skills/deliver/prd/` — Comprehensive Product Requirements Documents
   - `skills/deliver/user-stories/` — User stories with INVEST criteria and Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
   - `skills/deliver/launch-checklist/` — Pre-launch verification across all functions

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - CHANGELOG.md with v0.2.0 release notes
   - README.md roadmap showing Phase 1 complete
   - CONTEXT.md with current project state
   - plan-v1.md Progress Tracker with GitHub issue links

4. **Aligned Issue Numbering**
   - Updated plan-v1.md to use actual GitHub issue IDs (#10-14) for Phase 1
   - Added "GitHub Issue: *To be created*" notes for Phase 2/3 items
   - Removed conflicting internal reference numbers

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Hybrid approach for GitHub issues | Create issues phase-by-phase rather than all upfront — keeps issues fresh and aligned |
| Use GitHub issue IDs in plan | Avoid confusion between internal plan numbers and actual GitHub tracking |
| Phase 2/3 issues marked "TBD" | Will create GitHub issues when those phases start |

## Issues Encountered

1. **plan-v1.md not tracked in git** — The `_NOTES/` folder is gitignored by design (personal working docs). Edits are local only.

2. **Initial edit to plan-v1.md didn't persist** — Had to re-apply the Phase 1 Progress Tracker updates.

3. **Issue number conflicts** — Phase 1 skills were #6-10 in the plan but became #10-14 in GitHub. Phase 2/3 had overlapping numbers. Resolved by updating Phase 1 to use GitHub IDs and removing numbers from Phase 2/3.

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Start Phase 2: P1 Skills** (8 skills)
   - Create GitHub issues #15-22 (or next available)
   - Create labels: `phase-2`, `P1`
   - Create milestone: "v0.3.0 - P1 Skills"

2. **Skills to implement:**
   - interview-synthesis (Discover)
   - solution-brief (Develop)
   - spike-summary (Develop)
   - adr (Develop)
   - edge-cases (Deliver)
   - release-notes (Deliver)
   - experiment-design (Measure)
   - instrumentation-spec (Measure)

3. **Consider:** Create PR to merge `jprisant/issue1` branch to main before continuing Phase 2

## Session Highlights

**User Question:** Which approach for continuing pm-skills: Execute Phase 1 immediately OR create GitHub issues first?

**Resolution:** Hybrid approach selected — create GitHub issues for current phase, execute, repeat. Balances tracking with momentum.

**Key Commit:** `e312480` — "Complete Phase 1: P0 Core Skills (5 skills)"

**Files Created:**
- 15 new files (5 skills × 3 files each)
- SKILL.md, references/TEMPLATE.md, references/EXAMPLE.md per skill

**GitHub Issues Closed:** #10, #11, #12, #13, #14
