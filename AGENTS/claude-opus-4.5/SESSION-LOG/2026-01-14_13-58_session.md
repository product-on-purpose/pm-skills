# Session Log: 2026-01-14

## Summary

Established collaboration artifact conventions, performed comprehensive review of plan-v1.md, verified Phase 0 actual completion status (~40%), and created GitHub issues for all identified improvement opportunities.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **PLANNING Folder Convention**
   - Created `AGENTS/claude-opus-4.5/PLANNING/` for collaboration artifacts
   - Documented convention in CONTEXT.md architecture diagram
   - Added decision record to DECISIONS.md

2. **Plan-v1 Review**
   - Created comprehensive review at `PLANNING/plan-v1-review.md`
   - Identified 10 improvement opportunities (3 high, 3 medium, 4 low priority)
   - One high priority item (#4) was addressed during review

3. **Phase 0 Status Verification**
   - Verified actual completion: ~40% (not "complete" as documented)
   - Updated CONTEXT.md status
   - Updated plan-v1.md Progress Tracker with inline status notes
   - Fixed README.md roadmap section

4. **GitHub Integration**
   - Authenticated with GitHub CLI
   - Created v0.1 tag (plan review milestone)
   - Created 9 GitHub issues (#1-9) for plan improvements
   - Pushed all changes to origin

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| PLANNING folder location | Keep collaboration artifacts with other session files in AGENTS/ |
| VISION.md canonical location | Recommend keeping in `_NOTES/` (planning doc, not user-facing) |
| Phase 0 status | Accurately report ~40% rather than claiming "complete" |

## Issues Encountered

- GitHub CLI required authentication (resolved with device flow)
- Custom labels don't exist in new repo (used standard labels instead)

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Execute GitHub issues #1-3** (High Priority plan fixes)
2. **Complete Phase 0 Issue #1** from plan-v1.md (Repository Bootstrap)
   - Create missing directories with .gitkeep
   - Create CONTRIBUTING.md
3. **Continue Phase 0** — Issues #2-5 can run in parallel after #1

## Session Highlights

### Key Prompt: Establishing Collaboration Conventions
> "By default, for the pm-skills project... where would you put collaboration artifacts?"

This led to establishing the PLANNING folder convention, which provides a clear location for working documents like reviews and analysis.

### Key Discovery: Phase 0 Not Complete
Verification revealed significant gap between documented status ("Foundation complete") and actual state (~40% complete). Important for accurate project tracking.

### GitHub Issues Created
- #1: Fix Pre-Flight Checklist path reference
- #2: Decide canonical VISION.md location
- #3: Update Issue #1 to handle existing files
- #4: Add parallelization guidance
- #5: Add cross-platform validation commands
- #6: Update created date
- #7: Expand P1/P2 skill guidance
- #8: Update example dates in templates
- #9: Add dependency visualization diagram
