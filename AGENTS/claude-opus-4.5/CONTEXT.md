## Recent Work

- **v2.3.0 Shipped — B-01 Closed, B-02 Blocking Mode Active** (2026-02-14)
  - Merged release PR #103 and published tag/release `v2.3.0`
  - Closed B-01 with evidence (`B-01a`, `B-01b`, `B-01c`) as `closed-aligned`
  - Switched `.github/workflows/validate-mcp-sync.yml` to blocking-default mode
  - Added release note doc `docs/releases/Release_v2.3.md`
  - Validation: sync check passes in `block` mode (`24` vs `24`), no drift

- **Awesome-List Submission Campaign Researched** (2026-02-13)
  - Investigated all 12 target repositories from the submission plan (`_NOTES/repo-submission/submission-targets-popular-plan_2026-02-13.md`)
  - Created 12 detailed task documents in `_NOTES/repo-submission/task_*.md`, each with copy-ready PR text, exact entry format, risk assessment, and execution checklist
  - Best-bet targets: BehiSecc (5.8K stars, active), e2b-dev (25.8K stars, ~71% acceptance), kyrolabs (1.7K stars, fast turnaround)
  - Key findings: travisvn has ~1% community merge rate (gatekeeping); Shubhamsaboo (95K stars) requires contributing SKILL.md files directly; `dend/awesome-product-management` (1.3K stars) surfaced as new high-impact target
  - Ready for PR execution phase

- **MCP Sync Automation Planned** (2026-01-29)
  - Created comprehensive planning document: `_NOTES/efforts/mcp-builder-automation/plan_mcp-skill-automation_claude-code.md`
  - Analyzed two approaches: Validation-Only vs Full Automation
  - Recommended Validation-Only approach (~2 hours, ~75 LOC)
  - Key insight: Automate the checking, not the doing
  - Script location best practice: `/.github/scripts/` for CI, `/scripts/` for users
  - Created GitHub Issue [#98](https://github.com/product-on-purpose/pm-skills/issues/98)
  - Architecture: `.github/workflows/validate-mcp-sync.yml` + `.github/scripts/validate-mcp-sync.js`

    - Flattened resource URIs: `pm-skills://skills/{skill}`
    - Added `deriveToolName()` in `server.ts` for stable tool names
    - Updated workflow skill lookups for new naming
    - All 66 tests passing
    - Published to npm: `pm-skills-mcp@2.1.0`
    - Created GitHub release with v2.1.0 tag

- **v2.0.2 Released** (2026-01-27)
  - Validation workflow added (`validation.yml`) — runs on Ubuntu and Windows
  - Front-matter lint scripts created (`lint-skills-frontmatter.sh/ps1`)
  - Metadata cleanup: removed nested `metadata.version` from all 24 skills
  - Build scripts parameterized for versioned artifacts
  - Scripts guide renamed to `scripts/README_SCRIPTS.md`
  - Release typo fixed (`opensills` → `openskills`)

- **v2.0.0 Released** (2026-01-26)
  - Repository flattened to `skills/{phase-skill}/` structure
  - All 24 skills renamed with phase prefix (e.g., `deliver-prd`)
  - Sync helpers and build scripts added
  - Documentation updated for flat structure

- **v2.0 Execution Plans Complete** (2026-01-26)
  - Created detailed Claude execution plan with 8 phases, migration mapping for all 24 skills
  - Applied Codex's 5 feedback items: packaging, doc frontmatter, timeline dates, fail-fast sync helpers, validation
  - Created tool analysis comparing Claude Code vs Codex for execution
  - Recommendation: Codex 5.1/Max for execution (score 4.05/5), Claude for review/refinement (2.85/5)
  - Key decisions locked:
    - Flat structure: `skills/{phase}-{skill}/` replacing `skills/{phase}/{skill}/`
    - ZIP includes prebuilt `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/commands/`
    - Sync helpers validate SKILL.md, TEMPLATE.md, EXAMPLE.md with fail-fast
    - Two-path install guidance for Claude Code vs other tools
  - Packaging discrepancy noted between Claude and Codex plans (to reconcile before M4)
  - Plans located at `(internal-notes)/plans/v2.0-flat-extensions/`

- **v2.0 Planning: Structure, Output, MCP Impact** (2026-01-21)
  - Analyzed Claude Code skill discovery requirements (flat `.claude/skills/` vs hierarchical `skills/{phase}/`)
  - Created comprehensive planning documents in `AGENTS/claude-opus-4.5/PLANNING/`:
    - `plan_skill-structure-revamp.md` — 6 options for restructuring (keep current, flatten, phase prefix, numeric prefix, dual structure, flat+metadata)
    - `plan_skill-output.md` — Configurable file output (always file, always prompt, configurable default)
    - `plan_revamp-mcp.md` — Impact analysis for pm-skills-mcp (tool names, resource URIs, workflows, embed script)
  - Key findings:
    - Current hierarchical structure is agentskills.io compliant but NOT Claude Code auto-discoverable
    - Current `commands/` workaround enables slash commands but not skill discovery
    - Recommended: Option 3 (phase prefix) or Option 5 (dual structure) for Claude Code compatibility
    - MCP can remain backwards-compatible if tool names aren't changed
  - Awaiting stakeholder review before implementation
