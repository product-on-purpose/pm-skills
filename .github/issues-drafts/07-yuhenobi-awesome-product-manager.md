## Notes

Similar to hugo53's awesome-ProductManager but a different maintainer/community. Worth submitting for additional PM community reach.

Key points:
1. Professional PM frameworks automated via AI
2. Complete product lifecycle coverage
3. Based on proven methodologies
4. Open source and freely usable
5. Works across multiple AI platforms

Frame as a productivity multiplier for PMs rather than just another tool.
