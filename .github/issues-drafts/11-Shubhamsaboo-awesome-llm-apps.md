## Notes

Key distinction: This isn't just "skills for Claude" - it's demonstrating **how to build repeatable LLM workflows** for product work.

Frame as:
1. **LLM application pattern** - how to structure PM workflows with LLMs
2. **Production quality** - not experimental prompts
3. **Repeatable processes** - systematic approach to LLM outputs
4. **Professional results** - framework-based quality
5. **Practical use case** - real product team workflows

This positions pm-skills as an **example/reference** of how to build structured LLM applications for professional domains, not just a tool.

Emphasize "powering repeatable LLM workflows for product teams" as noted in the research.
