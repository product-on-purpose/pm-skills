## Notes

**Critical positioning:** Frame pm-skills as "agent-ready workflows" NOT "PM tool":
- **Structured processes** - repeatable, systematic
- **Consistent execution** - agents produce professional output
- **Framework-based** - not ad-hoc prompting
- **Production-ready** - battle-tested templates

Emphasize that these skills enable AI agents to perform PM work systematically:
1. Clear input/output contracts
2. Structured templates
3. Professional frameworks
4. Repeatable processes
5. Quality consistency

This is about **what agents can DO** (PM workflows) not what tools they use.
