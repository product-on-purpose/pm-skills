## Notes

The key question: does karanb192 accept skill collections/frameworks, or only individual skills?

If they accept collections:
- Position as a complete PM framework
- Emphasize 24 skills + workflow bundles
- Highlight professional quality and methodology basis

If they only accept individual skills:
- Could submit as a "meta-resource" or reference
- Or skip this list in favor of others

Check their existing entries to see if any are multi-skill repos or frameworks.
