## Repository Information

**Repository:** GetStream/awesome-saas-services
**URL:** https://github.com/GetStream/awesome-saas-services
**Category/Focus:** SaaS services directory - only relevant if pm-skills includes "PM tool stack" guidance

## Submission Details

### Target Audience
Developers and teams looking for SaaS solutions for various business needs.

### Positioning/Pitch
**Note:** pm-skills is NOT a SaaS service - it's an open-source skill framework. Only submit if they have a section for "Development Tools" or "Open Source Tools" that would fit.

### Relevant Section
**⚠️ Assess fit before submitting:**
- Would need "Developer Tools" or "Productivity Tools" section
- Or "Open Source Alternatives" section
- Unlikely to fit if purely SaaS services

### Submission Content

Open-source PM workflow framework for AI assistants (alternative to PM SaaS tools). 24 professional skills for product teams covering PRDs, user stories, experiments, retrospectives. Works with Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor. Apache 2.0 licensed - free for commercial use.

## Checklist

- [ ] Research repository structure and contribution guidelines
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Confirm they accept open-source tools, not just SaaS services
- [ ] Review if any non-SaaS entries exist
- [ ] Assess if pm-skills credibly fits their scope
- [ ] **DECIDE**: Submit OR skip if not relevant
- [ ] Draft tailored submission IF appropriate
- [ ] Check for existing pm-skills entry
- [ ] Submit PR following their contribution process (if proceeding)
- [ ] Track submission status
- [ ] Update this issue with PR link
- [ ] Close when merged/accepted OR close with "Not submitted - out of scope"

## Notes

**⚠️ LOW PRIORITY / LIKELY SKIP**

pm-skills is NOT a SaaS service - it's open-source software. This list is probably not a good fit unless:

1. They have "Open Source Alternatives" section
2. They include developer tools alongside SaaS
3. They're building a comprehensive "business tools" directory including free/OSS options

**Only submit if:**
- Clear precedent for open-source tools in the list
- They have relevant category (Dev Tools, Productivity, PM Tools)
- pm-skills wouldn't be the only non-SaaS entry

**Otherwise SKIP** - wrong category entirely.

Research first, likely don't submit.
