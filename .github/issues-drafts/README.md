## Key Messaging Guidelines

### Tailor to Audience
Each issue contains tailored messaging for its specific audience:
- **Claude Skills lists:** Emphasize skill collection, Agent Skills Spec compliance
- **PM lists:** Focus on practical utility, proven frameworks
- **AI/LLM lists:** Frame as systematic patterns, agent-ready workflows
- **Productivity lists:** Highlight efficiency gains, time savings

### Avoid Generic Pitches
Curators are allergic to generic plugs. Each submission should:
- Reference specific sections where pm-skills fits
- Explain how it fills a gap in their list
- Use language/framing matching their repository's vibe
- Be concise and value-focused

### Quality Over Quantity
Better to submit to 8 perfectly-targeted lists than 18 shotgun submissions. Prioritize:
1. Best audience fit
2. Clear positioning
3. Helpful addition to their list
