## Notes

Need to verify if VoltAgent accepts "meta" repos (skill collections/frameworks) or only individual skills. If they focus on single skills, may need to frame pm-skills as:
- A framework/collection that demonstrates best practices
- A reference implementation of workflow automation
- A complete solution rather than individual skills

Worth submitting if they accept workflow collections or framework repos.
