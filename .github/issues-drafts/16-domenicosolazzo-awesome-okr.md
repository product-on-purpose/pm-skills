- [ ] Assess if OKR connection is strong enough for dedicated OKR list
- [ ] Research repository structure and contribution guidelines
- [ ] Review existing entries for format/style
- [ ] Draft tailored submission emphasizing OKR alignment
- [ ] Check for existing pm-skills entry
- [ ] **DECIDE**: Submit if OKR angle is credible OR skip if connection too weak
- [ ] Submit PR following their contribution process
- [ ] Track submission status
- [ ] Update this issue with PR link
- [ ] Update [Planning Tracker](../../docs/internal/awesome-lists-submission-package_planning.md) with result
- [ ] Close when merged/accepted/won't-do

## Notes

**OKR-relevant pm-skills content:**
1. **opportunity-tree** - Teresa Torres' OST is explicitly outcome-driven
2. **hypothesis** - testable assumptions with success metrics
3. **experiment-design** - measuring progress on key results
4. **dashboard-requirements** - tracking KPIs aligned with OKRs
5. **problem-statement** - includes success criteria

**Submit IF:**
- Can credibly frame multiple skills as OKR-aligned
- Opportunity Solution Tree skill provides strong OKR connection
- List includes general goal-setting/measurement tools

**Skip IF:**
- List is purely about OKR frameworks/methodologies
- pm-skills OKR connection seems forced
- Would appear out of place

**If submitting, emphasize:**
- Outcome-driven discovery (OST)
- Hypothesis with measurable success criteria
- Experiment design for validating key results
- Connecting product work to objectives

This is nice-to-have distribution, not essential.
