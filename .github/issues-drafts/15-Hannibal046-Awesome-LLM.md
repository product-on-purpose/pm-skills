## Repository Information

**Repository:** Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM
**URL:** https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM
**Category/Focus:** Broad LLM resource list - more academic/tooling oriented

## Submission Details

### Target Audience
Researchers, ML engineers, and developers working with LLMs. Academic and technical focus.

### Positioning/Pitch
PM-Skills represents a structured, reusable methodology for LLM-assisted product management - a production use case demonstrating systematic LLM integration in professional workflows.

### Relevant Section
If accepted:
- "Applications" or "LLM Applications"
- "Use Cases"
- "Tools & Frameworks"
- "Professional Applications"

### Submission Content

**Title/Name:**
```
PM-Skills
```

**Description:**
```markdown
Structured methodology for LLM-assisted product management: 24 systematic workflows demonstrating repeatable LLM integration for professional PM work. Shows framework-based approaches to PRDs, user stories, hypotheses, experiments, and retrospectives. Production use case with Agent Skills Spec implementation.
```

**Link:**

**Academic framing:**
```markdown
Systematic LLM application framework for product management domain. Demonstrates structured prompt engineering, framework-based quality control, and repeatable workflow patterns. Reference implementation of Agent Skills Specification.
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Research repository structure and contribution guidelines
- [ ] Review if they include practical applications or purely research/tooling
- [ ] Assess if pm-skills has sufficient rigor for academic audience
- [ ] Draft tailored submission with methodology framing
- [ ] Check for existing pm-skills entry
- [ ] **DECIDE**: Submit OR skip if too application-focused for academic list
- [ ] Submit PR following their contribution process
- [ ] Track submission status
- [ ] Update this issue with PR link
- [ ] Close when merged/accepted

## Notes

**Challenge:** This is academic/research-oriented while pm-skills is practical/applied.

**Submit only if:**
- They include "LLM applications" or "use cases" section
- Existing entries show practical tools, not just research papers
- Can frame as "methodology" or "systematic approach"

**If submitting, emphasize:**
1. **Structured methodology** - systematic approach
2. **Reusable patterns** - framework-based
3. **Production use case** - real-world application
4. **Agent Skills Spec** - standards implementation
5. **Demonstrates** LLM integration patterns

**Academic angle:**
- Reference implementation of structured LLM workflows
- Demonstrates quality control via frameworks
- Shows systematic prompt engineering patterns
- Production-tested methodology

This is low priority - only submit if they clearly include practical applications alongside research.
