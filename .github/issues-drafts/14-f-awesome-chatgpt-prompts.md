## Checklist

- [ ] Research repository structure and contribution guidelines
- [ ] Confirm they accept meta-resources or prompt pattern collections
- [ ] Review if they list prompt collections vs individual prompts
- [ ] Consider adding "PM Skills Prompts" bridge document if needed
- [ ] Draft tailored submission
- [ ] Check for existing pm-skills entry
- [ ] **DECIDE**: Submit as-is, add bridge content, OR skip if too prompts-focused
- [ ] Submit PR or issue (per their process)
- [ ] Track submission status
- [ ] Update this issue with PR link
- [ ] Update [Planning Tracker](../../docs/internal/awesome-lists-submission-package_planning.md) with result
- [ ] Close when merged/accepted/won't-do

## Notes

**Challenge:** This list is very prompts-focused (individual prompts), while pm-skills is a structured framework/skill collection.

**Options:**
1. **Submit as meta-resource** - position as "systematic PM prompting patterns"
2. **Create bridge document** - add "PM Skills Prompts" section extracting key prompt patterns
3. **Skip** - if they only accept individual prompts

**If submitting:**
- Frame as "prompt engineering patterns" not just skills
- Emphasize systematic approach to complex PM prompts
- Position as reference for professional prompt structures
- Note that it demonstrates multi-step prompt workflows

**Research needed:**
Check if they have any "meta-resources" or "prompt pattern collections" - or if it's purely individual prompts.

This is secondary priority - huge audience but questionable fit without adaptation.
