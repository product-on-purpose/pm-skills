## Notes

**Productivity angle:**
Frame pm-skills as **efficiency multiplier**, not just PM tool:

1. **Time savings** - hours → minutes for PM artifacts
2. **Decision-making** - structured frameworks speed decisions
3. **Quality consistency** - professional output every time
4. **Workflow automation** - repeatable processes
5. **Context switching reduction** - integrated into AI assistants

**Emphasize:**
- Productivity gains (specific: "PRD in 5 minutes vs 2 hours")
- Automation of repetitive PM work
- Professional quality without the grind
- Focus on outcomes, not process

**Compare to:**
- Templates (but AI-powered)
- Consulting frameworks (but automated)
- PM tools (but integrated into workflow)

This is a good fit - productivity lists often include workflow automation and AI tools.
