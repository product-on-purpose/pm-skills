## Notes

e2b-dev is a serious AI agents list - positioning is critical. Frame as:

**Agent Capabilities:**
- Systematic PM workflows agents can execute
- Structured processes with clear inputs/outputs
- Professional quality via framework adherence
- Repeatable, consistent artifact generation

**NOT:**
- A tool for PMs
- Generic AI helper
- Prompt collection

Emphasize:
1. **Agent Skills Spec compliance** - standards-based
2. **Structured execution** - systematic processes
3. **Framework-driven** - not ad-hoc
4. **Production quality** - professional templates
5. **Complete coverage** - 24 distinct capabilities

This is about **extending agent capabilities** into PM workflows.
