## Notes

Frame as **devtool integration** not standalone PM tool:
- Works with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor
- Integrated into development workflow
- Brings PM capabilities into AI coding assistants
- Developer-friendly (slash commands, git integration)

Emphasize concrete tooling/workflow integrations:
1. **Slash commands** in Claude Code
2. **AGENTS.md discovery** in GitHub Copilot
3. **Works in Cursor, Windsurf** via Agent Skills Spec
4. **Git-based workflows** (clone, commit, integrate)
5. **Agent Skills Spec** compliance (standards-based)

This is about **extending AI developer tools** with PM capabilities, not a standalone PM product.

Good fit if they include workflow/productivity tools in their scope of "AI devtools."
