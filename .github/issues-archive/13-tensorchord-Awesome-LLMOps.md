## Checklist

- [ ] Research repository structure and contribution guidelines
- [ ] Confirm LLMOps scope includes workflow operationalization (not just infrastructure)
- [ ] Review existing entries to understand acceptance criteria
- [ ] Assess if pm-skills is rigorous enough for this serious list
- [ ] Draft tailored submission with LLMOps framing IF appropriate
- [ ] Check for existing pm-skills entry
- [ ] **DECIDE**: Submit OR skip if not credible fit
- [ ] Submit PR following their contribution process (if proceeding)
- [ ] Track submission status
- [ ] Update this issue with PR link
- [ ] Update [Planning Tracker](../../docs/internal/awesome-lists-submission-package_planning.md) with result
- [ ] Close when merged/accepted/won't-do OR close with "not submitted - out of scope"

## Notes

**⚠️ CAUTION:** This is a serious, infrastructure-focused LLMOps list. Only submit if pm-skills can credibly frame as "operationalizing LLMs."

**Submit IF:**
- They include "LLM application patterns" or "workflow operationalization"
- Existing entries show non-infrastructure projects
- Can position as "production LLM workflow pattern"

**Skip IF:**
- List is purely infrastructure/platform focused
- No workflow/application examples in existing entries
- Would seem out of place among ML engineering tools

**If submitting, emphasize:**
1. **Systematic processes** - not ad-hoc prompts
2. **Quality control** - framework-based validation
3. **Repeatable deployment** - works across platforms
4. **Production patterns** - structured inputs/outputs
5. **Operationalization** - standardized LLM workflows

This is lower priority - only submit if it's a credible fit after reviewing their entries.
