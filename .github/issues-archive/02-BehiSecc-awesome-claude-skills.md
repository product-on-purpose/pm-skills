## Notes

BehiSecc has excellent categorization - this should be a straightforward submission to their "Collaboration & Project Management" section. Emphasize:
1. PM-specific workflows (not generic productivity)
2. Team collaboration aspects (stakeholder summaries, retrospectives, refinement notes)
3. Project management artifacts (PRDs, launch checklists, release notes)
4. Professional quality with templates and examples

The categorization makes this a very natural fit - stronger alignment than most generic Claude Skills lists.
