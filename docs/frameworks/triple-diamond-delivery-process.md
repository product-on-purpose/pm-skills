# The Triple Diamond Delivery Process: A Comprehensive Guide

## Executive Summary

The Triple Diamond is an evolution of the well-known Double Diamond design process that extends beyond design-centric thinking to encompass the full product development lifecycle. Originally developed by Zendesk's product design team, this framework addresses a critical gap in traditional design methodologies: what happens after design concepts are validated but before products reach customers.

By adding a third diamond focused on validation and delivery, the Triple Diamond provides a more realistic representation of modern product development, emphasizing cross-functional collaboration between designers, engineers, product managers, and go-to-market teams.

## Origins: From Double Diamond to Triple Diamond

### The Double Diamond Foundation

The Double Diamond model was popularized by the British Design Council in 2005, though its intellectual roots trace back further to the divergence-convergence model proposed by Hungarian-American linguist Béla H. Bánáthy in 1996. The framework was built on contributions from design thinkers including John Dewey, Osborn & Parnes, Herbert Simon, and Donald Schön.

The Double Diamond's elegance lies in its simplicity: two diamonds representing alternating phases of divergent thinking (exploring possibilities broadly) and convergent thinking (narrowing down to focused solutions). The first diamond addresses the **problem space**, while the second addresses the **solution space**.

The original four phases are:

1. **Discover** — Understand the issue through research and user engagement
2. **Define** — Synthesize insights into a clear problem statement
3. **Develop** — Generate and explore potential solutions
4. **Deliver** — Test, refine, and implement the chosen solution

### Why a Third Diamond?

When Zendesk's product design team set out to document their design process, they turned naturally to the Double Diamond as their starting point. However, rather than adopting it wholesale, they used it as a conversation starter that revealed critical gaps in the model.

The team identified a fundamental limitation: the Double Diamond is too design-centric. As Mike Chen from Zendesk's design team articulated, the model creates an expectation that designs are "completed and handed off for implementation by engineers" — a simplification that doesn't reflect modern product development reality.

For Zendesk, "Ship" was oversimplified. The journey from validated design concept to commercially available product involves multiple internal milestones, cross-functional coordination, and iterative refinement that the Double Diamond framework doesn't capture.

This realization led to the creation of the Triple Diamond, which adds a third diamond to represent the **validation and delivery** phase of product development.

## The Triple Diamond Framework

The Triple Diamond extends the original model by acknowledging that user experience is not solely the designers' responsibility — it's a collaborative effort involving designers, engineers, product managers, QA teams, localization specialists, documentation writers, customer advocacy teams, and go-to-market functions.

### The Three Diamonds at a Glance

| Diamond | Focus | Key Question | Primary Activities |
|---------|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **First Diamond** | Problem Discovery & Definition | What problem are we solving? | Research, user interviews, data analysis, problem framing |
| **Second Diamond** | Solution Discovery & Development | How might we solve this? | Ideation, prototyping, user testing, concept validation |
| **Third Diamond** | Validation & Delivery | How do we ship this right? | Engineering collaboration, iterative refinement, staged rollout |

---

## Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### Diamond 1: Problem Discovery & Definition

The first diamond follows the traditional Double Diamond approach, focusing on understanding the problem space before jumping to solutions.

#### Discover Phase (Divergent)

The discovery phase involves immersing the team in extensive research and exploration:

- **User Research**: Conducting interviews, surveys, and observations to understand user needs, behaviors, and pain points
- **Market Analysis**: Examining competitive landscape, market trends, and emerging opportunities
- **Data Analysis**: Reviewing analytics, support tickets, and usage patterns to identify friction points
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Gathering perspectives from internal teams who interact with customers

The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the problem space by empathizing with users and uncovering opportunities that may not be immediately obvious.

#### Define Phase (Convergent)

With insights gathered, the team synthesizes research findings to define the problem clearly:

- **Insight Synthesis**: Identifying patterns, themes, and key findings from research
- **Problem Framing**: Articulating the core problem in a clear, actionable statement
- **User Journey Mapping**: Documenting the current customer experience and identifying intervention points
- **Persona Development**: Creating representative user profiles to guide design decisions
- **Success Criteria**: Establishing measurable outcomes that define what success looks like

The output is a well-defined problem statement that aligns stakeholders and provides a foundation for solution development.

### Diamond 2: Solution Discovery & Development

The second diamond shifts focus from understanding problems to generating and refining solutions.

#### Develop Phase (Divergent)

This phase encourages expansive thinking about potential solutions:

- **Ideation Sessions**: Brainstorming workshops that generate a wide range of potential solutions
- **Design Exploration**: Creating sketches, wireframes, and low-fidelity prototypes to visualize concepts
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Engaging engineers, product managers, and other stakeholders in solution generation
- **Technical Feasibility Assessment**: Early evaluation of what's technically possible within constraints
- **Competitive Analysis**: Examining how others have solved similar problems

The emphasis is on exploring many possibilities before narrowing down, avoiding premature commitment to a single approach.

#### Validate Phase (Convergent)

Selected concepts are refined and validated with users:

- **Concept Testing**: Presenting solution concepts to users for feedback
- **Usability Testing**: Evaluating how users interact with prototypes
- **Stakeholder Review**: Aligning with business stakeholders on proposed solutions
- **Iteration**: Refining designs based on feedback
- **Design Specification**: Creating detailed design documentation for implementation

The output is a validated design concept — not a final design, but a solution that has been tested with users and stakeholders and is ready for engineering collaboration.

### Diamond 3: Validation & Delivery

The third diamond represents Zendesk's most significant contribution to design process thinking. It acknowledges that the journey from validated concept to shipped product is itself a complex process deserving of structure and attention.

#### Key Insight: Design as Concept, Not Handoff

In the Triple Diamond framework, designs that emerge from the second diamond are treated as **concepts that have been validated** — not finished artifacts to be handed off. The team is confident it's the right solution, but it needs further refinement through the engineering and delivery process.

This reframing has profound implications for how designers and engineers collaborate.

#### The Iterative Agile Cycle

The third diamond marks the start of the iterative Agile development cycle, where:

- **Engineers investigate technical solutions** while designers continue creating prototypes and conducting usability tests
- **Research and design happen throughout** the development cycle, not just before it
- **Uncertainty decreases over time** as the team learns from implementation and user feedback
- **Flexibility for change decreases progressively** — larger changes happen early, fine-tuning happens later

#### Delivery Milestones

Zendesk identified specific milestones within the third diamond that capture the complexity of shipping products:

| Milestone | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Code Complete** | Feature development finished; localization begins; acceptance testing completed; documentation starts |
| **Early Access Program (EAP)** | Closed and open betas; security reviews; gathering real-world feedback from select users |
| **Limited Availability (LA)** | Commercially available to subset of customers; internal training for sales and support teams |
| **General Availability (GA)** | All customers can access the product or feature |
| **Public Launch** | Marketing begins; feature is actively promoted to the market |

Each milestone represents a convergence point where the product is evaluated against criteria before proceeding.

## Core Principles

The Triple Diamond framework is built on principles that guide teams throughout the process:

### 1. Empathy and User-Centeredness

Understanding user perspectives drives meaningful solutions. Teams should put themselves in users' shoes to gain deep insights into needs and challenges. This empathetic approach ensures that solutions address real problems and create meaningful experiences.

### 2. Cross-Functional Collaboration

User experience is everyone's responsibility. The Triple Diamond explicitly includes engineers, product managers, marketers, support teams, and other stakeholders in the process — not just designers. Different perspectives enrich solutions and identify potential issues early.

### 3. Embrace Change Throughout

One of the key tenets of the Triple Diamond is the acceptance of change. Rather than treating design decisions as locked-in, the framework acknowledges that continuous improvement and adaptation based on user feedback is essential. Flexibility for change is highest early in each diamond and decreases as convergence occurs.

### 4. Iteration Over Perfection

The first solution is rarely the best one. Through continuous prototyping, testing, and refinement, teams improve their ideas and solutions incrementally. This iterative approach ensures higher quality outcomes than attempting to get everything right the first time.

### 5. Divergent and Convergent Thinking

Each diamond follows the same fundamental pattern: expanding possibilities (divergent thinking) followed by focusing on the most viable options (convergent thinking). Understanding when to explore broadly versus when to narrow down is crucial for effective execution.

## Practical Applications

### Onboarding New Team Members

The Triple Diamond provides a clear overview of the product development lifecycle, helping new hires understand how their work fits into the broader process and what to expect at each stage.

### Design Critiques

Teams use position within the Triple Diamond to frame feedback appropriately. Early-stage concepts need different types of feedback than solutions approaching delivery. Understanding design maturity helps reviewers provide relevant input.

### Research Planning

The framework clarifies the goals and objectives of different research activities. Problem discovery research serves different purposes than concept validation testing, and the Triple Diamond makes these distinctions explicit.

### Status Updates

The visual representation enables clear communication of project progress to stakeholders. Teams can point to where they are in the process and what milestones are upcoming.

### Process Improvement

The Triple Diamond serves as a starting point for teams to reflect on their own processes. As Zendesk discovered, the value isn't just in the diagram — it's in the conversations it sparks about how work actually gets done.

## Adaptations and Variations

The Triple Diamond isn't meant to be adopted rigidly. As Zendesk's team emphasizes, every organization should use it as a frame of reference for building processes tailored to their unique challenges and goals.

### The Juxtaposed Diamonds Approach

Some practitioners have proposed variations where the third diamond overlaps with the second, representing how design and development can happen in parallel rather than sequentially. This adaptation accelerates delivery by enabling designers and developers to work side-by-side, continuously validating, refining, and iterating together.

### Integration with Agile and Lean

The Triple Diamond complements rather than replaces Agile and Lean methodologies:

- **Triple Diamond**: Ensures you understand customer problems and select impactful solutions
- **Lean**: Validates and iterates solutions through experiments and customer feedback
- **Agile**: Manages the execution and delivery of those solutions

### Scaling Considerations

For different project sizes:

- **Small projects**: May compress diamonds or run faster cycles
- **Large initiatives**: May expand each diamond into multiple sub-phases
- **Platform work**: May require separate Triple Diamond processes for different user segments
