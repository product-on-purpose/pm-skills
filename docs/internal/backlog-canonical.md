# Canonical Backlog Record

Status: Active  
Owner: Maintainers  
Last updated: 2026-02-16

## Canonical Source

Canonical backlog file:
- `_NOTES/efforts/backlog/backlog_codex_2026-02-02_pm_skills_consolidated_backlog_roadmap_and_multi_branch_execution.md`

Superseded backlog files:
- `_NOTES/efforts/backlog/backlog_codex_2026-01-29.md`
- `_NOTES/efforts/backlog/backlog_claude-code_2026-01-29.md`

## Operating Rule

When backlog items change:
1. Update only the canonical backlog file.
2. Keep superseded files read-only with redirect headers.
3. Reflect forward release plans/checklists in `docs/internal/release-planning/*.md` and release-ready outcomes in `docs/releases/*.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Release Cadence Anchors

- `v2.2.0`: guardrails and governance (`B-02`, `B-07`, `B-08`)
- `v2.3.0`: MCP alignment closure (`B-01`) and drift check enforcement (`B-02` block mode)
- `v2.4.0`: output/config contract lock closed-aligned (`B-03`, `B-04`)
- `v2.5.0`: foundation/persona decisions (`B-05`, `B-06`)
