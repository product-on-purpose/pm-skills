# v2.4 Contract-Lock Summary (Tracked)

Status: Shipped  
Release: v2.4.0  
Last updated: 2026-02-16

## Scope Closed

1. `B-03`: canonical output behavior contract lock.
2. `B-04`: canonical config schema/format contract lock.

Both blockers were closed as `closed-aligned` for v2.4.0.

## Canonical Outcomes

1. Output behavior contract is locked for prompt/file/hybrid behavior, collision handling, and path-safety expectations.
2. Config contract is locked for YAML canonical authoring, key policy, and strict/warn validation behavior.
3. Release-planning docs for v2.4.0 were updated to shipped state.

## Validation Summary

1. Determinism gates for `B-03` and `B-04` were recorded as PASS during v2.4 closure.
2. Config validator proof set validated strict/warn handling and expected invalid-fixture failures.
3. Cross-repo alignment guardrail (`validate-mcp-sync`) remained aligned for release truth.
