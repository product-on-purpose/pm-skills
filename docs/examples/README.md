# PM Skills Examples

Themed examples demonstrating how product management skills apply in creative contexts.

## Fantasy Software Companies

These examples showcase PM skills through the lens of fictional software companies in fantasy universes. While whimsical, they illustrate real PM practices.

| [Arrakis Logistics](./arrakis-logistics/) | Dune | Spice supply chain software |

## Why Fantasy Examples?

1. **Fresh perspective** — Familiar PM concepts feel new in unfamiliar contexts
2. **Memorable** — Storytelling makes frameworks stick
