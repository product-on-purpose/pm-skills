## Problem Statement

**For** freelance adventurers on the Sword Coast
**Who** struggle to find compatible parties for mid-tier quests (CR 5-10)
**The** current guild notice boards and word-of-mouth system
**Fails to** match adventurers by complementary skills, availability, and playstyle
**Because** there's no standardized way to communicate class capabilities, scheduling, or past performance
**Which results in** failed quests (23% TPK rate), payment disputes, and talented adventurers leaving for rival regions
**Unlike** the informal tavern networking that works for established parties
**Our solution** provides skill-based matching with verified adventure history and mutual reviews

## Context & Evidence

### Quantitative Signals

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average time to form a party | 6.2 days | Guild registry data |
| Quests abandoned due to party conflicts | 31% | Post-quest surveys |
| Adventurers who've had payment disputes | 67% | User interviews (n=24) |
| TPK rate for newly-formed parties | 23% | Healer's Guild mortality records |

### Qualitative Insights

> "I showed up to fight a beholder and they'd already recruited three rogues. THREE. No healer, no tank. We nearly wiped on the first trash mob."
> — *Lyra Shadowstep, Rogue (Level 8)*

> "The posting said 'dragon slaying experience preferred' but what they really needed was someone who could cast Water Breathing. I wasted a tenday traveling to the coast."
> — *Bramwell Thorngage, Druid (Level 6)*

### Current Alternatives

1. **Tavern Networking** — Works for regulars; excludes newcomers
2. **Guild Notice Boards** — No verification; attracts scammers and glory-seekers
3. **Temple Referrals** — Limited to divine casters; slow turnaround
4. **Word of Mouth** — Reputation-based but not scalable

## Scope Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Matching for standard dungeon crawls and monster hunts
- Parties of 3-6 adventurers
- Quest difficulty CR 1-15

**Out of Scope (for now):**
- Planar travel expeditions (different skill requirements)
- Solo quests
- PvP arena matching
- Guild-vs-guild campaigns
