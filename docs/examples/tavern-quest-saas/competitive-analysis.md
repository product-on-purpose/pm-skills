## Competitor Deep Dives

### HeroBoard

**Overview:** The incumbent in Waterdeep, HeroBoard dominates through network effects and a partnership with the city guard for official bounties.

**Business Model:** Pay-per-posting (5 gp standard, 20 gp featured). No subscription tier.

**Target Users:** Established guilds with marketing budgets; city-sanctioned quests.

**Key Insight:** Their model prices out freelancers and small guilds. 40% of Sword Coast adventurers have never used it.

**Strategic Implication:** We can capture the underserved freelancer segment with a freemium model.

---

### QuestGiver Pro

**Overview:** Built by a retired adventurer-turned-artificer, QGP has the best loot-splitting logic in the market but terrible UX.

**Business Model:** Flat subscription (50 gp/month). No free tier.

**Target Users:** Mid-size guilds running 5+ quests/month who need financial tracking.

**Key Insight:** Users love the loot features but complain about "needing a wizard's apprentice to set it up."

**Strategic Implication:** We should match their loot parity and beat them on usability.

---

### Dungeon Dispatch

**Overview:** Premium platform for high-stakes expeditions. Offers real-time party tracking via scrying network and casualty insurance partnerships.

**Business Model:** High subscription (200 gp/month) + per-quest fees. Enterprise sales.

**Target Users:** Wealthy guilds; noble-sponsored expeditions.

**Key Insight:** Their tracking tech is impressive but overkill for standard quests. Price is prohibitive.

**Strategic Implication:** Not our market short-term, but their tracking tech is a roadmap inspiration.

## Market Gaps & Opportunities

### Underserved Segments

1. **Freelance adventurers** — No platform serves their need to find parties (not just quests)
2. **New guild masters** — Steep learning curves and high costs lock them out
3. **Multi-class adventurers** — Current platforms categorize by primary class only

### Feature Gaps

1. **Skill-based matching** — Everyone does level-based; no one considers party composition
2. **Mutual reviews** — Most platforms only let quest-givers rate adventurers
3. **Dispute resolution** — Payment conflicts have no platform-mediated solutions

---

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Lead with Party Finder** — Unique differentiator; no competitor offers true matching
2. **Freemium for freelancers** — Capture the underserved 40% HeroBoard ignores
3. **Loot Ledger parity** — Match QuestGiver Pro's splitting but simplify setup
4. **Avoid real-time tracking (for now)** — Expensive; not core to our value prop
