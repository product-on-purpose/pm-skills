## Job Performer

**Harvester Crew Chief** — Responsible for spice extraction operations, crew safety, and equipment protection on the open desert.

---

## Core Functional Job

**When** I'm running a spice harvesting operation in the deep desert
**I want to** maximize spice yield while keeping my crew and equipment alive
**So that** we meet our quota without losses that trigger House Atreides investigations

---

## Job Map

| Stage | Job Steps | Pains | Gains |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **1. Preparation** | Scout extraction sites from orbital data | Outdated imagery; sandstorm interference | Reliable coordinates; pre-assessed worm activity |
| **2. Deployment** | Position harvester and begin operations | Carryall handoff delays; soft sand hazards | Smooth equipment drops; confirmed ground stability |
| **3. Extraction** | Operate harvester and fill hoppers | Vibration attracts worms; crew fatigue on long ops | Faster fill rates; predictable extraction windows |
| **4. Monitoring** | Watch for wormsign | Human spotters miss signs; thumpers fail | Early, reliable warnings; automated thumper deployment |
| **5. Retrieval** | Call carryall for equipment pickup | Radio blackouts; carryall availability unknown | Guaranteed pickup; clear communication |
| **6. Escape** | Evacuate crew if retrieval fails | Panic decisions; no protocol | Calm, rehearsed procedures; backup ornithopters |
| **7. Reporting** | Log yield and incidents | Manual data entry; CHOAM forms complex | Automated logging; audit-ready reports |

## Pains (Detailed)

### Critical Pains (Life/Death)

| Pain | Frequency | Intensity | Current Workaround |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Wormsign detected too late | 15% of ops | Extreme | Human spotters + prayers to Shai-Hulud |
| Carryall unavailable at pickup | 8% of ops | Extreme | Abandon equipment; crew escapes via 'thopter |
| Communication blackout during storms | 30% of ops | High | Pre-planned rendezvous; hope |

### Operational Pains

| Pain | Frequency | Intensity | Current Workaround |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Inaccurate spice density estimates | 60% of ops | Medium | Over-deploy harvesters; waste fuel |
| Crew scheduling conflicts | Weekly | Medium | Spreadsheets maintained by Mentats |
| CHOAM compliance paperwork | Daily | Medium | Dedicated admin staff; delays |

### Political Pains

| Pain | Frequency | Intensity | Current Workaround |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Fremen sabotage suspicion | Occasional | High | Stilgar liaison meetings |
| House Harkonnen information theft | Constant threat | High | Air-gapped systems; slow data sync |

## Gains (Desired Outcomes)

### Must-Have Outcomes

1. **Zero crew fatalities** — "If I lose one more person to a worm, I'm done"
2. **Equipment retrieval >95%** — Harvesters cost more than most fiefdoms
3. **Quota achievement** — Miss quota twice and it's a prison planet

### Performance Outcomes

1. **Extraction efficiency +20%** — More spice per deployment hour
2. **Fuel consumption -15%** — Fewer wasted scouting runs
3. **Reporting time <30 minutes** — Currently takes half a day

### Emotional Outcomes

1. **Confidence before deployment** — "I want to know my crew is coming back"
2. **Trust in data** — "Stop making me second-guess the systems"
3. **Pride in craft** — "We're the best extractors on Arrakis, not just survivors"

## Competitive Alternatives

| Alternative | What They Hire It For | Limitations |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Mentat calculations** | Strategic planning; perfect memory | Slow; can't scale to real-time ops |
| **Fremen scouts** | Wormsign expertise; desert survival | Political complexity; not always available |
| **Harkonnen surplus systems** | Cheap; available | Buggy; suspected backdoors |
| **Manual radio protocols** | Reliability; simplicity | Human error; slow response |

```
        PUSH (away from current solution)
        ────────────────────────────────
        • Crew losses unacceptable
        • Equipment costs unsustainable
        • CHOAM audits getting stricter

        PULL (toward new solution)
        • Predictive wormsign = lives saved
        • Automated dispatch = faster ops
        • Digital compliance = audit-proof

        ────────────────────────────────
        INERTIA (resistance to change)
        • "We've always done it this way"
        • Crew distrust of computers
        • Training time during peak season

        ────────────────────────────────
        ANXIETY (fears about new solution)
        • What if the system fails in a storm?
        • Harkonnen could hack it
        • Fremen might see it as surveillance
```

## Job Statements (Prioritized)

### Primary Jobs (Address First)

1. **Minimize time-to-warning when wormsign appears** — Currently 4 minutes; need <90 seconds
2. **Guarantee carryall availability at retrieval request** — Currently 92%; need 99%
3. **Maintain communication during sandstorms** — Currently 70% uptime; need 95%

### Secondary Jobs

4. Reduce deployment planning time from 2 hours to 30 minutes
5. Automate CHOAM compliance reporting
6. Enable Fremen-compatible interfaces (non-surveillance mode)

### Tertiary Jobs

7. Integrate with stillsuit telemetry for crew health monitoring
8. Predictive maintenance for harvester components
9. Historical analysis for spice bloom patterns

## Key Insights

1. **Safety trumps efficiency** — Crews will sacrifice yield for survival guarantees
2. **Trust must be earned** — Desert workers distrust technology until it saves their life once
3. **Political layer is real** — Any system must work for Fremen partnership, not against it
4. **Offline-first is non-negotiable** — Storms happen; systems must degrade gracefully
