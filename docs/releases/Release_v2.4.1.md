# PM-Skills v2.4.1 Release Notes

Date: 2026-02-16  
Status: Shipped

## Big Idea

v2.4.1 is a patch follow-up to v2.4.0 focused on release-documentation and communication alignment.

## What Was Delivered

1. Release metadata consistency updates:
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with explicit `2.4.1` entry.
- `README.md` updated for current stable badge/version references.
- `docs/releases/Release_v2.4.md` references remain aligned with shipped v2.4.0 contract-lock scope.

2. Release-planning reference alignment:
- `docs/internal/release-planning/checklist_v2.4.0.md`
- `docs/internal/release-planning/Release_v2.2_to_v2.5_execution-plan.md`

3. Long-form internal engineering learning artifact:
- `docs/internal/Releases_2.3-2.4_detailed-breakdown.md`

## Validation Performed

- Confirmed v2.4.1 version markers across changelog/README.
- Confirmed release-planning docs still indicate v2.4.0 ship state and closure truth.
- Confirmed no new contract behavior claims beyond v2.4.0.

## What This Means

- `v2.4.1` is documentation and release-communication hardening.
- `v2.4.0` remains the behavior-contract baseline for output/config decisions.

## Non-Goals for v2.4.1

- No new PM skills were added.
- No changes to B-03/B-04 contract semantics.
- No changes to v2.5 scope (`B-05`, `B-06`) beyond planning continuity.
